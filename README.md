# translation-supporter

## Overview

This is a translation support tool especially for lyrics. It can retrieve lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/). Using the lyrics, you can translate them line by line in two windows.

It requires a [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) client access token, so prepare it in advance. You don't need the token if you prepare the lyrics by yourself and paste or write them into the window.

## Run

```sh
bash run.sh
```
